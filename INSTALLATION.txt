To install:

1. If not alread installed, download and install the following packages:

	a. The numpy python library - provides fast floating-point array
		operations in python. Versions earlier than 1.6 may not work.
		(http://numpy.scipy.org/)

	b. The Cython python package - provides a variant of python that
		compiles into C code that can itself be compiled and is faster (but
        less flexible) than ordinary python. Versions earlier than 0.17
		may not work.
		(http://www.cython.org/)

	c. The gvar module which handles Gaussian random variables. This is
		available on pypi (pip install gvar) or, as source code,
		at https://github.com/gplepage/gvar.git.

	d. The matplotlib package for 2-d plotting. This is optional
		unless you want to make pictures of the vegas grid
		(see the documentation on How vegas Works).

	e. The mpi4py package (and MPI itself) for multi-processor
	   	evaluation of integrands. This is optional.

	f. pip is used for installing (and uninstalling) vegas. pip usually
	    comes with python. pip can be used to install numpy, cython, gvar,
	    and matplotlib as well.
	    (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)

	All but the third of these libraries are often included in 3rd-party
	distributions of python.

	The vegas code works for Python 2.7 and 3.3-3.6. It has not been tested
	for earlier versions.

2. Use 'make install'. This will build the vegas packages, and
	then copy it into a standard directory in the user's space that
	Python knows about. A list of the installed files is stored in file
	files-vegas.python (in case, for example, you want to uninstall them).

	N.B. Rather than using make and the makefile, one can instead use
	standard distutils commands: eg, 'pip install . --user' (from
	within the main directory), or python distutils commands
	like 'python setup.py install --user'.

	N.B. If you have previously installed older versions of vegas,
	consider removing the earlier modules to make sure that the new ones are
	used by Python. This will not be a problem if the new modules overwrite
	the older ones, but could cause trouble if the new modules are written
	to a different place. Find out where the older modules are stored by
	using 'pydoc vegas' before installing the new software
	(pydoc lists the location of the module under "FILE").

	N.B. To install vegas for an alternative version of pip, say pip3
	for example, use 'make PIP=pip3 install'. Python's standard
	directories are structured in such a way that it is necessary to do
	a separate installation for each python version that will be used for
	vegas.

3. (Optional) Run 'make tests' to test your installation of vegas.
	The tests have been successful if the output ends with "OK".
	Some tests involve random numbers and so may occasionally --- less than
	1 in 100 runs --- fail due to rare multi-sigma fluctuations; rerun the
	tests if they do fail. Contact g.p.lepage@cornell.edu if there are
	persistent, frequent failures.

	N.B. The tests can also be run directly using Python's unittest module:
	"python -m unittest discover".

4. (Optional) Change to subdirectory examples/ and look at some of the
 	sample .py files given there that use vegas. Run them one by one ---
	"python simple.py" etc --- or all at once using "make run".

5. (Optional) Use 'make clean' to erase work files/directories.


To uninstall:

1. 'make uninstall' uninstalls what was installed. It uses pip uninstall.
