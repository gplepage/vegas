Version 4.0 2021-04-21
=======================
This update changes one aspect of the default algorithm 
for adaptive stratified sampling. Specifically it no longer 
uses the same number of stratifications in each direction:
Mst+1 stratifications are used in the first D0 directions 
and Mst in the remaining directions. This allows for more 
hypercubes, which reduces errors and improves stability. 
For many problems the difference is negligible, but 
this change can lead to large improvements for high 
dimensions or with a small number neval of integrand 
evaluations. In particular there will always be some 
stratification for arbitrarily high dimensions. The 
default stratification is determined by neval and 
new parameter neval_frac.

A related change is that AdaptiveMaps can now have 
different numbers of increments in different directions.

Version 3.5.4 2021-03-28
========================
Minor update to fix a bug (in _fill_sigf) when minimize_mem=True. 
Also resets the default for max_neval_hcube to 1e5. Introduces 
new parameter max_mem.

Version 3.5.3 2020-10-29
========================
Fixes bug (again) on Windows (only) involving mismatched integer types.

Version 3.5.2 2020-10-29
========================
Fixes bug on Windows (only) involving mismatched integer types.

Version 3.5.1 2020-09-19
=========================
Documentation fixes; no changes to the code.

Version 3.5 2020-09-14
=========================
This update adds new functionality. First, the new 
method AdaptiveMap.adapt_to_samples(x, f) optimizes the 
vegas map for integrals of function f(x). This can be 
used to precondition vegas before integrating. 
See "vegas Maps and Preconditioning vegas" 
in the tutorial for more details.

Second, the number of stratifications used by vegas for 
its adaptive stratified sampling can now be set for each 
direction separately. This is particularly useful in 
high dimensions where it becomes increasingly 
difficult to have more than one stratification per 
axis. See "vegas Stratifications" in the tutorial
for more information.

Other changes:

- New method AdpativeMap.invmap(x, y, jac) computes the y values 
  and Jacobian corresponding to points x. It is the 
  inverse of AdaptiveMap.map(y, x, jac), although 
  jac is dx/dy in both cases.

- AdaptiveMap.show_grid has a new keyword argument: plotter.

- vegas results now include result.sum_neval which equals the 
  total number of integrand evaluations used to obtain the result.

Version 3.4.5 2020-06-16
========================
Still trying to fix that bug. Problem was in RAvgArray._inv
which is used when computing weighted averages of results 
from different iterations when there are multiple integrands.
Specifically the issue is what to do when there is a linear 
combination of the multiple integrands that is exactly zero 
(which turns out to be natural in certain contexts), since 
this leads to a singular covariance matrix (whose inverse 
is needed for the weighted average). Current fix is 
similar to scipy.linalg.pinvh.

Version 3.4.4 2020-06-14
========================
Small bug fix to previous bug fix.

Version 3.4.3 2020-06-08
=========================
Small bug fixes.

- Adds left-out part of the bug fix in 3.4.2. 

- Fixes problem that could sometimes lead 
  gvar to complain about non-symmetric 
  covariance matrices. Thanks to 
  Jolyon Bloomfield for pointing this 
  out.


Version 3.4.2 2020-02-05
========================
Bug fix for situations where the error in the answer 
is smaller than 1e-8 times the answer -- ie, unlikely 
to affect many existing codes. The old code reported 
cumulative errors that were too large. (Thanks to 
Gabriele Spada for pointing this out.)

Version 3.4.1 2020-01-01
========================
Minor documentation update; can be ignored otherwise.

- Updates examples to account for changes in mpirun.

Version 3.4 2019-04-11
=======================
Again a very minor update, to respond to a feature request.

- Adds mpi keyword to Integrator. Setting mpi=False disables mpi support in
  vegas even if mpi is available; setting mpi=True (default) uses mpi
  automatically (so long as it is installed).

- Improved documentation on the use of C and Fortran with vegas.

- A new section in the tutorial on how to calculate distributions with vegas.


Version 3.3.6 2018-07
==========================
Very, very minor update.

- Fix compatibility issue with v11 of lsqfit.

- Improved pypi documentation.

- Improved makefile.

Version 3.3.5 2018-06-24
=========================
Minor update; minor bug fixes.

- Documentation fixes.

- Fixed bugs associated with parameters minimize_mem=True and beta=0.
  These resulted in sub-optimal behavior.

- New timing information in vegas.reporter(). Also flushes stdout after
  each iteration.


Version 3.3.4 2018-03-18
========================
Tiny change to test scripts to account for changes in numpy.


Version 3.3.3 2018-02-16
========================
- Improved installation script, especially when cython and numpy not
  installed. cython is no longer necessary. numpy and gvar should be
  installed automatically if they are not present.

- Trivial changes to tests.

- Slight rearrangement of documentation.


Version 3.3.2 - 2018-01-04
==========================
Bug fix (in setup.py) to address installation problems on some systems.


Version 3.3.1 - 2017-01-02
==========================
Bug fix that allows code to work on Windows (fixes type mismatch having to do
with different conventions for integer lengths).


Version 3.3 - 2017-01-02
==========================
vegas.PDFIntegrator rewritten to make it more efficient.
The interface is the same.


Version 3.2 - 2016-11-20
========================
MPI (multi-processor) support is now integrated into vegas
and automatically avaible for any integrand without modifying
its code --- simply run the code using, for example,

  mpirun -np 4 python your-code.py

to distribute integrand evaluations over 4 processes (and processors if you
have that many). You no longer need to convert the integrand using
vegas.MPIintegrator; MPIintegrator is no longer needed for anything. I left it
in vegas for legacy purposes, but you should discontinue its use.

Other changes:

- The stopping conditions (atol and rtol) now work. I forgot to install
  the stopping conditions in earlier versions, mostly because I never use
  them. These stopping conditions can be quite unreliable in early iterations,
  before vegas has converged --- use them with caution if you use them at all.
  Thanks to Kevin Andrade for pointing out that they were not working.

- Given output r from a vegas integrator, added new option to r.summary().
  Using r.summary(extended=True) appends a table showing the final results
  for every component of the integrand (not just the part used to adapt
  vegas).

- Extra documentation on how to access integrands written in C or
  Fortran from Python vegas. New (simpler) documentation on using MPI.


Version 3.1 - 2016-11-05
========================
Added new class PDFIntegrator for evaluating expectation values weighted
by the probability density function (PDF) for arbitrary multi-dimensional
Gaussian distributions. This class once resided in module gvar but
had to be moved to vegas to avoid circular imports (which are bad) in the code.
It is part of the setup for Bayesian integrals (BayesIntegrator)
in the lsqfit module.

Also fixed a bug in MPIintegrator that caused occasional crashes.


Version 3.0.1 - 2016-08-14
===========================
- Corrected small bugs in RAvg.summary(), RAvgArray.summary() and
  RAvgDict.summary(). Summary tables give weighted averages when
  weighted=True, unweighted averages otherwise. summary() has an
  optional argument (weighted) to overwrite the default setting in
  the RAvg, etc. Summary tables used to always list weighted averages,
  whether or not weighted=True.

- Corrected small bug in code for batch integrands that return dictionaries.
  vegas is supposed to adapt to the first entry in dictionary-valued
  functions, where 'first' is defined to be the first entry in dictionary[k]
  where k is the first key in dictionary.keys().


Version 3.0 - 2015-07-23
=========================
Starting with this version, vegas requires module gvar ('pip install gvar') in
order to function. In the past it used a (very poor) substitute for gvar if
that module was not installed. That kludge is not sustainable.

- Integrand functions in the past could return numbers or numpy arrays. Now
  they can also return dictionaries whose values are either numbers
  or numpy arrays. This is useful in situations where multiple integrals are
  being done simultaneously since the keys can be used to document and  keep
  straight which integral is which. This should make code  easier to read and
  write.

- Miscellaneous internal changes to simplify the vegas code that handles
  integrands.

- Switch to pip for installing and uninstalling. It is more robust than
  the alternatives.


Version 2.2.2 - 2014-11-25
==========================
Very minor fix: changes in numpy v1.9 broke MPIintegrand. It is now
fixed.


Version 2.2.1 - 2014-10-4
=========================
This is a minor bug fix release.

- Fixed a bug that caused option adapt_to_errors to malfunction. The
  malfunction caused the integral to be less than optimal, although
  still correct.

- Cleaner implementation of the (Feynman) path integral example.


Version 2.2 - 2014-06-28
=========================
There is a new decorator, vegas.MPIintegrand, that makes it trivial to
evaluate integrands on mupliple processors using MPI. See the tutorial section
on Multiple Processors for more discussion. This is only useful for
integrands that are expensive to evaluate.

Beginning with this version of vegas, version numbers will be consistent
with the rules of "semantic versioning" (http://semver.org). The most
important consequence is that any change that is *not* backwards compatible
with the current interface (as defined by the documentation) will be signaled
by a change in the major version number, where the full version number has the
format major.minor.patch (so the major version number is 2 for version 2.1.4).
A side effect of this policy is that increases in the major version number can be
triggered by relatively obscure changes in the interface that have no
effect whatsoever on almost all existing codes. The minor component increased
for this version because it adds new functionality; but it remains compatible
with the previous version.


Version 2.1.4 - 2014-02-05
============================
More small changes (all backwards compatible).

- vegas.Integrator has new parameter ran_array_generator. This is the random
  number generator used by vegas. The default function is numpy.random.random.
  The new parameter allows users to substitute a different random number
  generator, if they wish.

- Legacy name vegas.VecIntegrand now works. This isn't needed for new code
  (use vegas.BatchIntegrand), but saves having to update old code.

- The path-integral example is a little bit more organized.

- Ongoing polishing of documentation.


Version 2.1.3 - 2014-01-13
=============================
The last (probably) in a series of very minor changes. Here only the
documentation has been changed. There is a new section in the Tutorial
showing how to use multiple CPUs to evaluate costly integrands in parallel.
There is also a new section on how to use vegas to do multi-dimensional sums,
rather than integrals.

Also fixed errors in the documentation for random and random_batch generators.


Version 2.1.2 - 2014-01-12
============================
Another very minor (backwards compatibile) modification. Internally vegas processes
integration points in batches. These were called vectors initially but this name
has proven confusing, especially now that integrands can be array-valued.
To remove the potential confusion, collections of integration points are
now called batches, and: VecIntegrand is now BatchIntegrand; vecintegrand is
now batchintegrand; and nhcube_vec has become nhcube_batch. The old names
are still available, as aliases, to support legacy code.


Version 2.1.1 - 2014-01-09
==========================
This is a very minor upgrade. Missed out a couple of variable declarations
in one of the cython routines that slowed the routine (and vegas) down
significantly (eg, 20%) in some situations. These are now fixed. This
changes nothing other than the run time.


Version 2.1 - 2014-01-08
=========================
vegas normally uses weighted averages to combine results from different
iterations. This is important since earlier iterations may have much larger
errors and so should carry less weight in the average. The weighted averages
mean, however, that the integral estimates are biased (see discussion of
systematic error in the Tutorial). The bias is completely negligible compared
to the statistical errors, and so unproblematic, unless the number of
iterations (nitn) is made very large (eg, thousands). vegas does not need to,
and no longer does use weighted averages when parameter adapt=False, because
then different iterations are all the same (since there is no adaptation
going on). Consequently the estimates for the mean and std deviation
are unbiased when adapt=False. This is likely a non-issue for most
and possibly all applications (since the bias vanishes so quickly with
increasing neval --- like 1/neval), but taking unweighted averages is
more correct when adapt=False so that is what vegas does now.

Other changes:

- Added parameter adapt to Integrator, as mentioned above. Setting alpha=False
  prevents vegas from adapting any further. See the discussion in the Tutorial.

- RWAvg and RWAvgArray have changed names to RAvg and RAvgArray. The R
  stands for "running", since these objects keep a running total. The "W"
  used to stand for "weighted" but is inappropriate now since averages
  may be weighted or unweighted (depending upon parameter Integrator.adapt).

- Changed the way vegas handles situations where variances
  (or diagonal elements of covariance matrices) are negative or otherwise
  afflicted by roundoff error. A small positive number is added, scaled by
  the mean**2 (roughly 1e-15 * mean**2). This helps vegas survive unusual
  situations like a constant integrand (independent of x) without generating
  nan's or divide checks.

- Have more robust mechanisms for defining integrands for vegas's vector
  mode. Deriving from vegas.VecIntegand but failing to define a __call__
  results in an error message (saying there is no __call__). Also there
  is now a function decorator, vegas.vecintegrand, that can be applied
  to an ordinary function to make it suitable as an integrand.


Version 2.0.1 - 2014-01-07
===========================
Tiny improvement in how vegas interacts with the gvar module. The gvar
module can now be installed by itself, without the rest of the lsqfit
distribution: pip install gvar. Array-valued integrands work much better
with gvar installed.


Version 2.0 - 2014-01-06
==========================
This is a significant upgrade and cleanup of the code. As a result
it is not entirely backwards compatible with earlier versions (see below).

- Integrands are allowed to be array-valued now, with different elements
  of the array representing different integrands. vegas always tunes on
  the first function in the array. vegas determines whether the
  integrand is scalar- or array-valued automatically, and returns
  results that are either scalar or array-valued, as appropriate.
  This functionality replaces method Integrator.multi, and is
  implemented quite a bit differently (and better);
  Integrator.multi has now disappeared. There is no longer a need for a
  separate method for array-valued integrands.

- The calling conventions for integrands in vector mode have been changed
  (simplified): eg,

    class fv(vegas.VecIntegrand):
      def __call__(self, x):
        return x[:, 0] ** 2 + x[:, 1] ** 4

  See discussion in the tutorial. This is not compatible with the old
  convention. The fcntype argument to Integrator is no longer needed.

- Renamed RunningWAvg to RWAvg -- shorter name. Also introduced RWAvgArray
  for arrays of same.

- Major reorganization of the internal code to simplify the developer's
  life. The code appears to be somewhat faster, though probably not
  enough to be noticed by anyone other than the developer.



Version 1.3 - 2014-01-03
========================

- Introduced new method Integrator.multi for doing multiple integrals
  simultaneously, using the same integration points for all of the
  integrals. Integrating simultaneously can lead to very large reductions
  in the uncertainties for ratios or differences of integrals whose
  integrands are very similar. See discussion in the documentation under
  "Multiple Integrands Simultaneously."

- Introduced iterators (Integrator.random and Integrator.random_vec)
  that return |vegas| integration points and weights
  for applications that use |vegas| as a random number generator.

- Changed the semantics concerning the memory optimization introduced in
  v1.2. To run with minimum memory set parameter minimize_mem = True. This
  will cause vegas to use extra integrand evaluations, which can slow it by
  50-100%, but also decouples the internal memory used from neval. The
  default value, False, is the better choice unless vegas is running out
  of RAM. Parameter max_nhcube limits the number of h-cubes used in the
  stratification, unless beta=0 or minimize_mem=True in which case it is
  ignored.


Version 1.2 - 2013-12-29
========================

- Memory optimization: The (new) adaptive stratified sampling algorithm
  can use a lot of memory since it must store a float (sigf = the std dev of
  the integrand) for each h-cube. When neval gets to be 1e8 or larger,
  the memory needs start to approach typical RAM limits (in laptops,
  anyway). To avoid exceeding these limits, which would greatly slow
  progress, vegas now switches to a different mode of operation when
  the number of h-cubes exceeds parameter max_nhcube (set by default
  to 5e8). Rather than store values of sigf for every h-cube for use
  in the next iteration, it recomputes sigf just before it uses it
  to move integrand evalutions around (and then throws the sigf value away).
  This requires extra integrand evaluations, beyond those used to estimate
  the integral. The number of extra evaluations is between 50% and 100% of
  the number used to estimate the integral, typically increasing
  execution time by the same fractions. This is worthwhile provided the
  adaptive stratified sampling decreases errors by at least 30%
  (since omitting it would allow up to 2x as many integration points
  for the same cost, decreasing errors by a factor of 1/sqrt(2)). The
  adaptive stratified sampling usually decreases errors by this amount,
  and frequently by much more. The new mode is in operation if (internal)
  attribute minimize_sigf_mem is True. Again the threshold for this
  new behavior is set by max_nhcube which is 5e8 by default, which
  is sufficiently large that this new mode will be used quite
  infrequently.

- Refactored Integrator._integrate to prepare for future project.

- Tests for beta=0.0 mode and for the propagation of Python exceptions
  from the integrand.

- More polished documentation - still a work in progress.

- Fixed bug in pickling of Integrator. Added testing for pickling.

Version 1.1.1 - 2013-12-22
============================
Fixed a tiny typo that would not cause problems particularly,
but needed to be fixed --- code would not import gvar from lsqfit
even if it was present.

Also made the slower examples run faster, so you don't have
to wait so long. Added a plot to the path-integral example to
compare the lattice path-integral result with the exact result
(provided matplotlib installed).

Version 1.1 - 2013-12-22
=========================

Original release made use of the lsqfit package in the testing. This package
is quite useful in conjunction with vegas (for the gvar module) but it is not
required. The testing and examples now work without  lsqfit present, which was
the original intent. See discussion at the  end of the Tutorial about the role
of lsqfit.

Version 1.0 - 2013-12-21
==========================
This is the first version of a new implementation
of the vegas algorithm for adaptive multidimensional
Monte Carlo integration. It is written in Python/Cython
and features a significantly improved algorithm
relative to earlier versions of vegas. In particular
it now uses two adaptive strategies instead of one.
