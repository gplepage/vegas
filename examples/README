These .py files are simple examples showing how to use vegas. Use 'make run'
to run most of them, and compare their output against the corresponding .out
files. This will also try to run code on multiple processors, using MPI
(assumes MPI installed); the makefile assumes the openmpi version of mpirun.

Some of these examples are discussed in the vegas documentation (which
starts at doc/html/index.html):

    simple.py - From "Basic Integrals" in the Tutorial.

    slow.py - The slowest but easiest way to code an integrand.

    faster.py - A vectorized integrand, for greater speed.

    fastest.py - An integrand coded in Cython, for even greater speed.

    bayes.py - Bayesian curve fitting in 3 and 21 dimensions.

    path-integral.py - Quantum mechanics using Feynman's path integral.

    parallel-pools.py - Parallel processing using Python's multiprocessing module

Several examples demonstrate how to use integrands written in C or Fortran.
The ctypes code will probably not work on windows machines because of
machine-specific procedures for creating (and naming) shared libraries.
The others should work everywhere.

    cfcn-ctypes.py - Uses Python's ctypes module to link to C code in cfcn.c

    cfcn-cython.py - Uses an interface to C code written in cython (see
        cfcn_cython.pyx and build information in cfcn_cython.pyxbld),

    cfcn-f2py.py - Uses f2py to create a module from C code in cfcn.c, using
        interface file cfcn_f2py.pyf.

    ffcn-f2py.py - Uses f2py to create a Python module from Fortran code
        in ffcn.f.
