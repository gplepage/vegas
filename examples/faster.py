"""
Three Gaussians spread along the diagonal of a  six-dimensional hypercube.

This coding style for the integrand is more complicated than slow.py but
leads to run times that are 20x shorter because the integrand is expressed
in terms of numpy arrays and whole-array operations, thereby greatly reducing
the overhead from Python.

Compare performance with slow.py and fastest.py.
