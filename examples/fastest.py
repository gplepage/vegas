"""
Three Gaussians spread along the diagonal of a  six-dimensional hypercube.

This coding style for the integrand is almost as simple as slow.py
but much faster because the integrand is coded in Cython and compiled.
Run times are 20x shorter than slow.py.

Runtime is about the same for faster.py and fastest.py. This is because
the cost of evaluating the integrand is almost negligible in both
cases; most of the time is taken by the Integrator as it generates
random points and adapts the grid. The integrand by itself is more than
twice as fast in Cython compared with the numpy-vectorized integrand
(in faster.py), and also much more flexible.
