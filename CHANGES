Version 1.3 - 2014-01-03
========================

- Introduced new method Integrator.multi for doing multiple integrals 
  simultaneously, using the same integration points for all of the 
  integrals. Integrating simultaneously can lead to very large reductions
  in the uncertainties for ratios or differences of integrals whose
  integrands are very similar. See discussion in the documentation under
  "Multiple Integrands Simultaneously."

- Introduced iterators (Integrator.random and Integrator.random_vec) 
  that return |vegas| integration points and weights
  for applications that use |vegas| as a random number generator.

- Changed the semantics concerning the memory optimization introduced in 
  v1.2. To run with minimum memory set parameter minimize_mem = True. This
  will cause vegas to use extra integrand evaluations, which can slow it by
  50-100%, but also decouples the internal memory used from neval. The 
  default value, False, is the better choice unless vegas is running out 
  of RAM. Parameter max_nhcube limits the number of h-cubes used in the
  stratification, unless beta=0 or minimize_mem=True in which case it is 
  ignored.


Version 1.2 - 2013-12-29
========================

- Memory optimization: The (new) adaptive stratified sampling algorithm
  can use a lot of memory since it must store a float (sigf = the std dev of
  the integrand) for each h-cube. When neval gets to be 1e8 or larger, 
  the memory needs start to approach typical RAM limits (in laptops, 
  anyway). To avoid exceeding these limits, which would greatly slow 
  progress, vegas now switches to a different mode of operation when
  the number of h-cubes exceeds parameter max_nhcube (set by default 
  to 5e8). Rather than store values of sigf for every h-cube for use
  in the next iteration, it recomputes sigf just before it uses it 
  to move integrand evalutions around (and then throws the sigf value away). 
  This requires extra integrand evaluations, beyond those used to estimate
  the integral. The number of extra evaluations is between 50% and 100% of
  the number used to estimate the integral, typically increasing 
  execution time by the same fractions. This is worthwhile provided the
  adaptive stratified sampling decreases errors by at least 30% 
  (since omitting it would allow up to 2x as many integration points
  for the same cost, decreasing errors by a factor of 1/sqrt(2)). The
  adaptive stratified sampling usually decreases errors by this amount,
  and frequently by much more. The new mode is in operation if (internal)
  attribute minimize_sigf_mem is True. Again the threshold for this
  new behavior is set by max_nhcube which is 5e8 by default, which 
  is sufficiently large that this new mode will be used quite 
  infrequently. 

- Refactored Integrator._integrate to prepare for future project.

- Tests for beta=0.0 mode and for the propagation of Python exceptions
  from the integrand.

- More polished documentation - still a work in progress.

- Fixed bug in pickling of Integrator. Added testing for pickling.

Version 1.1.1 - 2013-12-22
============================
Fixed a tiny typo that would not cause problems particularly, 
but needed to be fixed --- code would not import gvar from lsqfit
even if it was present.

Also made the slower examples run faster, so you don't have 
to wait so long. Added a plot to the path-integral example to 
compare the lattice path-integral result with the exact result
(provided matplotlib installed).

Version 1.1 - 2013-12-22
=========================

Original release made use of the lsqfit package in the testing. This package
is quite useful in conjunction with vegas (for the gvar module) but it is not
required. The testing and examples now work without  lsqfit present, which was
the original intent. See discussion at the  end of the Tutorial about the role
of lsqfit. 

Version 1.0 - 2013-12-21
==========================
This is the first version of a new implementation
of the vegas algorithm for adaptive multidimensional
Monte Carlo integration. It is written in Python/Cython
and features a significantly improved algorithm
relative to earlier versions of vegas. In particular
it now uses two adaptive strategies instead of one.
